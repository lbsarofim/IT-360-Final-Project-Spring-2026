# Project Proposal
For our project, we are going to create an automated file scanner that utilizes API requests to VirusTotal, a well-known file scanner, to determine if a file is malicious or not. This program will be able to take in a file or folder, send it to VirusTotal, then return the score and what type of malicious file it could be. It will also provide specific steps to remove the file and ensure that the rest of the network is safe based on the type of malware.
